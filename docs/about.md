# Drawing joy from everyday life

Hello there, I’m Nicola, the owner of Nicolour Illustration and Design. I’ve been illustrating and filling sketchbooks for over 40 years – drawing is part of who I am. When I became a mum, my children quickly became my muses. Capturing their everyday moments in soft, storybook-style illustrations made me smile, and I realised others might love to see their own little ones brought to life in the same way.

That’s when I began creating bespoke illustrations using pencil and watercolour to craft unique keepsakes that celebrate the people and moments that matter most.

With over 25 years of experience as a professional illustrator, I’ve had the joy of working on a wide range of creative projects: set design in Austria, magazine illustration for the BBC, fabric design, and character design for children’s television.

For the past seven years, I’ve also taught art and illustration to children aged 5 to 16 at an arts charity and across the Bradford district as part of the [Hockney DRAW initiative](https://bradford2025.co.uk/programme/draw/) - where I have led workshops for ages 3 to 103!

I’ve also been thrilled to work with the [Big Draw](https://www.thebigdraw.org/about-us/launch-2025) on their magnificent opening event at East Riddlesden Hall.


Always with a smile (and a sketchbook) at hand, I love helping others find joy and peace through drawing and art.

I absolutely adore art, drawing, creating and crafting, and I’m always enthusiastic and knowledgeable on any project; I love the conversations and the joy that drawing and art can bring to the everyday. My background in Graphic Design also helps me on a daily basis create professional and memorable designs and illustrations.

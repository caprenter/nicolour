# Have a go at something unique and leave smiling

Always with a smile on my face and a bucketful of positive comments and tips and techniques to enhance your experience, I love teaching all manners of creativity and art. 

I can be found at after school clubs, community centres and many other venues helping all participants to leave with renewed confidence in their abilities. 

I can teach everything from drawing skills, lino printing and collage through to painting and clay work.

I can regularly be found at [The Crafthouse](https://www.yorkshirecrafthouse.com/) in Bingley, where I run workshops based predominantly in drawing, ink, and watercolour. This is a wonderful venue and the food is glorious - a great mindful and calming time guaranteed.

[Get in touch]({% link contact.md %}) if you’d like me to teach at a venue near you.

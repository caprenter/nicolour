# Your Special Day, Captured in Illustration

Capture the magic of your special event with a bespoke illustrated keepsake.

Whether it’s a wedding, birthday party, or community gathering, I attend your event and sketch moments live on the day. These sketches are then lovingly compiled into a vibrant A3 digital illustration that is completely unique to you and your celebration.

Alternatively, send me your photos and I’ll compile them into a one-off illustration to commemorate your special day or event. A joyful, personal way to remember the people, places, and laughter that made your day so special.

There are so many options for this: wedding guests, party guests, members of a board meeting. I can illustrate them beforehand to create memorable table decorations or favours to take home and treasure, or they can be illustrated afterwards to complete the story of the day.
